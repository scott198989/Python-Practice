### Errors in Python

#### What it is:
In Python, errors are raised when the interpreter encounters an issue it can't resolve. These issues can range from syntax errors to runtime errors. Errors are also categorized into built-in exception classes.

#### Why you'd use it:
Understanding errors is crucial for debugging and improving the quality of your code. Also, you can handle errors to prevent your program from crashing.

#### Syntax & Examples:

1. **Syntax Error**
    ```python
    print("Hello, World!"  # Missing closing parenthesis
    ```
    Output: `SyntaxError: unexpected EOF while parsing`

2. **Runtime Error (ZeroDivisionError)**
    ```python
    x = 10 / 0  # Divide by zero
    ```
    Output: `ZeroDivisionError: division by zero`

3. **Handling Errors using try-except**
    ```python
    try:
        x = 10 / 0
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("Cannot divide by zero!")
    ```
    Output: `Cannot divide by zero!`

#### Common Use Cases:
- Debugging and fixing issues in your code.
- Writing robust programs that can handle unexpected situations.

### Custom Error Classes

#### What it is:
Custom error classes allow you to define your own exception types. These are useful for flagging domain-specific issues and making your code more readable.

#### Why you'd use it:
By creating custom exceptions, you can make your error messages more descriptive and easier to understand. This is especially useful for debugging or if your code will be used by other developers.

#### Syntax & Examples:

1. **Creating a Custom Error**
    ```python
    class MyCustomError(Exception):
        pass
    ```

2. **Raising the Custom Error**
    ```python
    def do_something(bad_thing):
        if bad_thing:
            raise MyCustomError("Something bad happened.")
    
    try:
        do_something(True)
    except MyCustomError as e:
        print(f"Caught an exception: {e}")
    ```
    Output: `Caught an exception: Something bad happened.`

#### Common Use Cases:
- When you have application-specific conditions that the built-in exceptions don't cover.
- Making your code self-documenting by giving errors meaningful names.
